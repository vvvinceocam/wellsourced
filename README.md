> Content-Security-Policy made easy

`wellsourced` is a command-line toolkit to simplify working with Content-Security-Policy (CSP).

It provides 2 sub-commands:
- `wellsourced audit`: audit CSP headers of a website;
- `wellsourced collector`: microservice to collect CSP headers from a website, logging them and sending them
  to a webhook.
